  # Firebase Core and Auth are crucial. Your previous versions were quite old,
  # which often leads to interop issues, especially on web.
  # I've updated them to the latest versions found in your provided facts.
  firebase_core: ^3.13.1 # Updated from 2.24.1
  firebase_auth: ^5.5.4 # Updated from 4.15.1
  # You mentioned "Add a user authentication flow to a Flutter app using FirebaseUI"
  # and "Configure dependencies" for Firestore. These packages were missing.
  firebase_ui_auth: ^1.5.0 # Essential for FirebaseUI authentication flows. (Please verify latest on pub.dev)
  cloud_firestore: ^5.6.8 # Essential for Firestore data storage. (Updated to latest known)
  # It's good practice to use caret (^) for other dependencies too,
  # allowing for minor version updates without manual intervention.
  http: ^1.1.0 # Already using caret, good.
